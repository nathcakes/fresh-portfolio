Since the [industry talk](https://nateb.dev/blog/industry-talk), I've been thinking a lot about alternative careers in the software engineering space, especially relating to developer engagement and education. One of my key takeaways from this experience was building my online presence.

Michelle encouraged us to build our presence on LinkedIn by liking and making meaningful comments on a post every day and posting our thoughts at least once a week. I was initially very committed to this suggestion, and for the first two weeks after the talk, I was doing my best to stick to her recommendations.

At the end of the two weeks, I realised although LinkedIn is a great tool, especially for professional networking, I needed to build a wider audience. I posted about a theme I created, hitting a milestone of 35 thousand downloads. However, I didn't receive the type of engagement I hoped for.

**Artefact:** [LinkedIn Post Celebrating 35 thousand downloads](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7100280556772286464/)

Over the summer break, I will pivot to developing my site further with more tech-related blog posts and begin a YouTube channel to discuss tech ideas and provide educational resources. I want to build a brand using my name to further my reach and open more opportunities for myself in the developer engagement field in the future.
