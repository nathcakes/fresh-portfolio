Hello, world! 


Topics to Right about: 

Keep It Simple: 
    This is abound on the internet, do things in a basic way and then build upon them. Maybe I need to listen to advice better 
    but I'll repeat for anybody who didn't hear from the back, keep it simple! 
    I wanted to use cool new technologies like Deno and Astro, and I certainly got a little too focused on Deno. I'm glad I've learnt something new but I could have got this out earlier. 

Simple Designs: 
    I thought I had a clear picture in my head about how I wanted everything to go, and although that was true, having a basic wireframe/design built in Figma or Penpot really boosted my motivation. 

Take Notes: 
    The amount of times I went over something that I was like oh wait i've seen this before but then proceeded to look up again. Use a simple note-taking software and right down the solution to problems you faced. 

Don't Reinvent the Wheel: 
    At least on your first try. Take advantage of the stuff that's out there. 

Start Small and Build Up: 
    This goes hand in hand with the simple designs, but once you have gotten a design out on a page, implement the most basic blocks first. Put all your pieces on the page. Then tackle one at a time how you will style and interact with them. 
    This advice won't always work for more complex projects but certainly on your portfolio site or blog, it's a good idea to start small and build up.
