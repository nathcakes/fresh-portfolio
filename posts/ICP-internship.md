At the start of the year, I had signed up to be part of Innovation Central Perth's (ICP) intern pool after they visited our NPSC class. I was contacted at the start of August to interview for a project with a local start-up called Omni Biotech. Omni has created an algorithm that can measure hydration through the sensors in a standard wearable device, and they needed some help putting together a mobile application for users to access this algorithm.

When I received the offer, Jack had already been working on the project for a few months and had made great progress on some of the backend pieces needed in Amazon Web Services, which I wasn't familiar with. My main task was to start working on the mobile application that would communicate with the wearable device and provide results to the users.

So far, it's been an exciting challenge, I'm really interested in the product that Omni is making and really glad to be working on something in the health & wearables industry. It's really expanded my "soft skills" having to discuss with them requirements for the application, as well as working on design while learning a new programming language and framework.  

So far, Jack and I have delivered an architecture diagram to demonstrate the flow of data through the application and into the AWS backend.
